# Terraform Provider for Arista CloudEOS

The Arista CloudEOS provider helps with automating the deployment of a multi-cloud network
fabric using Arista CloudVision as a Service ( CVaaS ). The provider interacts with CVaaS to
create a BGP/EVPN/VxLAN based overlay network between CloudEOS Routers running in various
regions across Cloud Providers.

## Terminology

* CVaaS : Arista [CloudVision](https://www.arista.com/en/products/eos/eos-cloudvision) as-a-Service.
  CloudVision as a Service is the root access point for customers to utilize the CloudEOS solution.
  CVaaS supports a single point of orchestration for multi-cloud, multi-tenant and multi-account management.
* CloudEdge - CloudEdge is a instance of CloudEOS that provides interconnection services with other public clouds
  within the clientâ€™s autonomous system. The CloudEdge also interconnects VPCs and VNETs within a cloud provider region.
* CloudLeaf - CloudLeaf is an instance of CloudEOS that is deployed in the VPC and VNETs that hosts the applications VMs.
  It is the gateway for all incoming and outgoing traffic for the VPC.
* Cloud Network Private Segment (CNPS) - The VRF name used for segmentation across your cloud network.
* CLOS topology - EPVN based spine-leaf topology to interconnect all leaf VPCs in a region
    to the CloudEdge routers deployed in the transit/Edge VPC.
* WAN topology - EVPN based full mesh topology to interconnect all the CloudEdges over Internet.
* DPS - [Dynamic Path Selection](https://www.arista.com/en/cg-veos-router/veos-router-dynamic-path-selection-overview)

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.12+
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.13 (to build the provider plugin)

## Usage

### CloudEOS Provider
```
provider "cloudeos" {
  cvaas_domain = "apiserver.arista.io"
  cvaas_server = "arista.io"
  service_account_web_token = "..."
}
```

### Argument Reference
* cvaas_domain - (Required) CVaaS Domain name
* cvaas_server - (Required) CVaaS Server Name
* service_account_web_token - (Required) The access token to authenticate the Terraform client to CVaaS.

## Resources
Documentation for the resources supported by the CloudEOS Provider can be found in the [resources](https://github.com/aristanetworks/terraform-provider-cloudeos/tree/master/docs/resources) folder.

## Limitations and Caveats

### v0.1.0
* The `cloudeos_topology, cloudeos_clos and cloudeos_wan` resources do not support updates. These resources cannot be
  changed after the other cloudeos resources have been deployed.
* A CloudLeaf VPC and Router should only be deployed after a CloudEdge VPC and Router have been deployed.
  Without a deployed CloudEdge router, CloudLeaf routers cannot stream to CVaaS.
* A CloudEdge should only be destroyed after all the corresponding CloudLeafs have been destroyed.
* The VPC `cidr_block` cannot be changed after the VPC is deployed. You will have to delete the VPC and redeploy
  again.
* Before deploying the CloudEOS router, the Configlet Container must be manually created on CVaaS.
* CloudEOS Route Reflector Routers ( with `is_rr = true` ) can only be deployed in a single VPC.
* CloudEOS Route Reflector should be deployed in the same VPC as one of the CloudEOS Edge Routers. If you want the
  Route Reflectors to be in its own VPC, create a new `cloudeos_clos` resource and associate the `cloudeos_vpc_config`
  resource with the `cloudeos_clos` name.
* The `cnps` attribute for the `cloudeos_vpc_config` doesn't support updates.
  To update `cnps` you will have to redeploy the resource.
